            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>In The Light is a first person atmospheric walking sim experimenting with games and their ability to
                be a digital collection of physical material. Players explore a house located in the far reaches of Northern
                California, traversing through time and collecting cassettes, with a soundscape made from my own childhood home videos.

            <h3>Details</h3>
            <p>holy moly i will write this later</p>
            <p>it'd be good for this section to maybe be placed under a read more because it'd get real wordy.
                for the thesis in particular i think it'd be good to have a link out to the actual published paper
                (this will give me better metrics lol)
